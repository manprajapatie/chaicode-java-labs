 * Sam's Tax Calculator
 *
 * <p>Sam is a freelance graphic designer who dreads tax season every year.
 * Help Sam by building a tax calculator that uses progressive tax brackets.
 *
 * <p>How progressive tax works:
 * You don't pay the same rate on ALL your income. Each "slice" of income
 * is taxed at its own rate:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Bracket 1: $0 – $10,000        → 0%  (tax-free!)</li>
 *   <li>Bracket 2: $10,001 – $30,000   → 10% (only on the amount ABOVE $10,000)</li>
 *   <li>Bracket 3: $30,001 – $70,000   → 20% (only on the amount ABOVE $30,000)</li>
 *   <li>Bracket 4: Over $70,000        → 30% (only on the amount ABOVE $70,000)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Examples:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Income $8,000   → Tax = $0 (all in bracket 1)</li>
 *   <li>Income $20,000  → Tax = 10% of ($20,000 - $10,000) = $1,000</li>
 *   <li>Income $50,000  → Tax = $2,000 + 20% of ($50,000 - $30,000) = $6,000</li>
 *   <li>Income $100,000 → Tax = $2,000 + $8,000 + 30% of ($100,000 - $70,000) = $19,000</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If income is 0 or negative, return 0</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param income annual income in dollars
 * @return total tax amount owed
