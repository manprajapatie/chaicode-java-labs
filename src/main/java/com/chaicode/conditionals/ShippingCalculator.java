 * ShopSwift Shipping Calculator
 *
 * <p>ShopSwift is a growing online store. They've hired you to build their
 * shipping cost calculator. The cost depends on the package weight,
 * where it's going, and the order total.
 *
 * <p>Domestic Shipping (country equals "US"):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Weight up to 1 kg:   $5</li>
 *   <li>Weight up to 5 kg:   $10</li>
 *   <li>Weight over 5 kg:    $15</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>International Shipping (any other country):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Weight up to 1 kg:   $15</li>
 *   <li>Weight up to 5 kg:   $25</li>
 *   <li>Weight over 5 kg:    $40</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Free Shipping:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Domestic orders over $50 get FREE shipping (return 0)</li>
 *   <li>International orders over $100 get FREE shipping (return 0)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If weight is 0 or negative, return -1</li>
 *   <li>If orderTotal is negative, return -1</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param weight package weight in kilograms
 * @param country destination country code (e.g., "US", "UK", "IN")
 * @param orderTotal total order amount in dollars
 * @return shipping cost, 0 for free shipping, or -1 for invalid input
