/**
 * The Driving Simulator
 *
 * <p>SafeDrive Driving School is building a simulator for new students.
 * You need to write the logic that tells student drivers what to do
 * when they encounter different traffic light signals.
 *
 * <p>Signal → Action:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>"green"        → "GO"</li>
 *   <li>"yellow"       → "SLOW DOWN"</li>
 *   <li>"red"          → "STOP"</li>
 *   <li>"flashing red" → "STOP AND PROCEED WITH CAUTION"</li>
 *   <li>anything else  → "INVALID SIGNAL"</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Rules:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The function should be case-insensitive
 *       (e.g., "GREEN", "Green", "green" should all return "GO")</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Hint: Use a switch statement!
 *
 * @param color the traffic light signal
 * @return the driving action to take
