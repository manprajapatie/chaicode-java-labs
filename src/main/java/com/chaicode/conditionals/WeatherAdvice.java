 * temperature (in Celsius) and whether it's raining, the app should
 * display helpful advice to hikers.

 *   <li>temp &gt;= 25 and no rain  → "Great weather for hiking - don't forget sunscreen"</li>
 *   <li>temp &gt;= 25 and raining  → "Warm but rainy - consider indoor activities"</li>
 *   <li>temp &gt;= 15 and no rain  → "Perfect hiking weather - enjoy the trails"</li>
 *   <li>temp &gt;= 15 and raining  → "Cool and rainy - bring waterproof gear if hiking"</li>
 *   <li>temp &gt;= 5 and no rain   → "Chilly - wear layers for your hike"</li>
 *   <li>temp &gt;= 5 and raining   → "Cold and wet - best to stay indoors"</li>
 *   <li>temp &lt; 5                → "Too cold - stay warm indoors"</li>
